BAGGAGE HANDLING SYSTEM FOR A MAJOR AIRPORT
===========================================

Designing Aspect
================
Baggage handling system within major airports is one of the fundamental components that define the efficiency of 
the entire airport. Effective implementation of the system requires a consideration of various elements, 
which seek to enhance the functioning of the system in handling large amounts of baggage, and in seeking to reduce 
congestion within the airport. Efficiency of the designing process of the system remains essential in ensuring quality
in the functional capacity of the system upon implementation.

In seeking to achieve quality, a number of elements must be considered during the designing phase of the system.
One such element is the requirements, which can be defined as the fundamental purposes for which the baggage system 
will be implemented within the airport. Assessment of the various requirements like security and accuracy in sorting
the baggage remains essential in ensuring the system serves the functions it has been designed to perform. Requirements assessment
will be undertaken during the designing phase to ensure all the requirements become integrated into the system.

The other element is design. This will be essential in ensuring maximisation of the available resources in meeting the requirements
of the system. Consideration of the location which the system will be installed becomes essential within this aspect this will 
defined by other factors like the point of loading and off-loading for the baggage. The physical design of the system will be
the fundamental consideration in seeking to ensure functional efficiency.

There are numerous risks that could result in poor development of the system. These include the following;
•	Failure:
-----------
All systems remains subject to failure if not properly designed. Failure remains the fundamental
risk which the system faces once implemented. The risk of failure within the project will be mitigated through
sufficient testing of the system before beginningoperations. Since functional failure can also occur a back-up system
will be developed in seeking to ensure the services do not become interrupted in the event of a system failure. 

•	Usability:
------------
The system faces the risk of becoming dysfunctional within the airport setting. The individuals working within
the airport and directly linked to the system will be provided with training to ensure familiarisation with the functioning
of the system.

Testing Approach
================
In consideration of the risk and design factors identified above, the system will be subjected to various tests in seeking
to enhance functional capacities for the system.
Sortation testing – this will be essential in testing the integration of the software containing the information to the physical
element of the system. This will be essential in ensuring the system utilises available information about luggage in accurately
directing the luggage to the necessary locations.

Load testing – this will test various loading elements of the system including load balancing. A simulation baggage system
will be initiated during the initial phase in seeking to test the loading capacity regarding maximum weight of the baggage. A final 
testing process will be done after implementation to ascertain the movement of load and establish the maximum capacity for
the system.

System testing – this will be undertaken in seeking to establish the suitability of the system in relation to the current
demands as established by the requirements of the design phase. This will also involve the integration testing between 
the software and the hardware components of the system as they have to integrate well in achieving efficiency through
the system.
